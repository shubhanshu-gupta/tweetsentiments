tweetsentiments
===============

Analyse the sentiments of the tweets fetched of a particular topic. 

The new sentiment analysis on tweets has been done using R. It solves the following problems:
1. Collect tweets using the twitter api
2. Collect about 10,000 tweets
3. For each tweet, assign it a sentiment score. The sentiment score can be defined as the number of happy words - the number of negative words. You should be able to find a dictionary of positive and negative words online (search for AFINN-111.txt)
4. Find the top 10 happy topics, and top 10 sad topics. A topic would be a hashtag.

Hence, the code helps in understanding how to assign a sentiment score to a tweet and how to fetch a corpus of 10,000 tweets.
